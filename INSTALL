Just download or clone the 'spang' repository, and make path to the
executable files in the 'spang/bin' directory.
Just make sure that the 'spang/bin' directory is in the command path.

Example in the case of bash:
$ cd ~               # any directory where you like to install spang
$ git clone https://github.com/dbcls/spang
$ ~/spang/bin/spang  # See if the main spang command works
$ export PATH=$HOME/spang/bin:$PATH  # Set path the executable files

Installation of requied Perl modules:
In typical Unix environmets, spang will run out of the box. But in
some environment, you may have an error message like:
 Can't locate LWP/UserAgent.pm in @INC
It means the Perl module is missing. In such cases, install the
necessary Perl modules using system like cpanm. If you don't have
cpanm command, install as follows:
$ cd ~/bin
$ curl -L https://cpanmin.us/ -o cpanm
$ chmod +x cpanm
$ export PERL_CPANM_OPT="--local-lib=~/perl5"     # cpanm installs modules here
$ export PERL5LIB=$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5:$PERL5LIB # Perl scripts find modules here
$ ~/bin/cpanm LWP/UserAgent.pm                    # install the Perl module
$ ~/spang/bin/spang    # See if the main spang command is executable

Installation of requied Java Archive(.jar) files:
Some additional commands included in spang package require Java
Archive files imported from other projects.
'rdf2nt-huge' command requires ConvRDF (https://github.com/dbcls/ConvRDF).
'tdprun' command requires TripleDataProfiler (https://bitbucket.org/yayamamo/tripledataprofiler).
Download the .jar files and place them in the 'spang/lib' directory.
$ cd ~/spang/lib
$ curl -LO https://github.com/dbcls/ConvRDF/raw/master/ConvRDF.jar
$ curl -RO https://bitbucket.org/yayamamo/tripledataprofiler/raw/7550bf65a70d569373ae466c8f0b0f5f9b399527/TripleDataProfiler.jar
$ ls
ConvRDF.jar  TripleDataProfiler.jar
